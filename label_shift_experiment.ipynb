So given an annotation, the distribution in the latent space should be the same for the two datasets which might be sort of true if we can assume that the network extracts some underlying characteristics of our data) and that the difference in the joint distribution arises from the fact that $p(a) \\neq q(a)$.\n",

        "* Now I only worked with three annotations, big, medium, small. For this setting it is easy to construct a network that predicts these three annotations well from the images. But if we have many annotations, like brightness can range from 0-255, bounding box corner can range from 0-20 etc. This creates a huge classification problem for the network. And I think we somehow need it to be a classification problem because the method relies on $p(a|x)$ being probabilities. So if one wants to train a network to predict bounding box coordinates with mean squared loss then one has to find a way to convert the corresponding values to probabilities before applying the algorithm.\n",
        "* A possible solution to the above problem would be to work with annotations on different levels. So create \"large\" annotation classes and see if the expectations on the simulated dataset match those on the observed dataset first. And then find the areas where the expectations are mismatched and explore those further. Like in the example above we could see that our expectation for the small circle class have been met and thus we can maybe just continue with investigating the large and medium class and create/modify a network to predict these better. Like maybe create new classes like \"medium circles in top right corner, medium circle in bottom left, etc\" and then apply the same method and see where the expectations differ now.\n",
        "* Now there is no difference in $G$ and $G^*$ for the train and test set but this might affect the end results as well.\n",
        "* I also mentioned in the beginning that we might be able to assume $p(f(x)|a) = q(f(x)|a)$ but maybe one needs to think more about this.\n",
        "* Also the dataset here might be a bit too easy and that is why the results are so good here.\n"
